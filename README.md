# Everything is Seasonal

This github repo is designed as a place to store/reference the data, code, and sources behind my 'Everything is Seasonal' talk at OpenVisConf. 

The presentation itself can be found [here](https://slides.com/zanarmstrong/everything-is-seasonal)

## Summary

If your data includes change over time, take seasonality into account.

Seaonality are patterns that repeat over known, fixed periods of time [-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality#cite_note-1).

Assume that your metric has a seasonal cycle. 

## 6 recommendations

1. Consider the seasonality of causal factors
2. Aggregate to time periods that make sense for your data
3. Sometimes seasonality is the story
4. Adust for seasonality when estimating the impact of an event ('causal analysis')
5. The seasonality that matters most might be in a subset of your data
6. Seaonal patterns vary by place, culture, and lifestyle

#### De-seasonalizing data with X-12 ARIMA

[Seasonal package in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seasonal/vignettes/seas.pdf)

[Blog post](http://www.r-bloggers.com/new-online-tool-for-seasonal-adjustment/) about seasonal adjustment with this package

#### Decomposing a time series with STL

[Original 1990 article](http://www.wessa.net/download/stl.pdf) on STL decomposition. 

[Intro to STL](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/5)

[STL in R](http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/stats/stl). Note that STL operates on an object of the "ts", or time series" class. So, you'll need to convert data to this format first. 

#### Bayes Impact Analysis with the R package CausalImpact

[Analyzing Functional Time Series](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/shang.pdf)
The curves/functions/components that drive machine learning might also have seasonality. "Recent advances in computer recording and storing technology have tremendously increased the presence of functional data, whose graphical representation can be infinite-dimensional curve, image, or shape. When the same functional object is observed over a period of time, such data are known as functional time series."
