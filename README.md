# Everything is Seasonal

This github repo is designed as a place to store/reference the data, code, and sources behind my 'Everything is Seasonal' talk at OpenVisConf.

## Summary

If your data includes change over time, take seasonality into account.

Seaonality are patterns that repeat over known, fixed periods of time [-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality#cite_note-1).

Assume that your metric has a seasonal cycle. 

## 5 recommendations

1. Consider the seasonality of causal factors
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

## Analysis Tools

##### De-seaonalizing data

##### Decomposing a time series with STL

##### Bayes Impact Analysis with the R package CausalImpact
